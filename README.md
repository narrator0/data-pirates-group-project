## Sprint Planning #2

### Summary of Project

For our project, we would like to create an app that provides a platform for people who want to get connected with employees/recruiters of tech companies by asking for referral or mentorship to increase their chance of getting hired.

### What we did

We finalized that our weekly sprint planning meeting time would be on Thursdays at 4-5pm. During this past week, every member contributed to creating a prototype for the app. During our standup meetings, we discussed the features needed. Then, as a group we visualized our ideas on a Figma project. We have finalized the pages we would implement for our app. These pages include: Login, Sign up, Verification, Home, User Profile (Public View and Self View), Chat Screens (one-on-one convo and an inbox page), Setting, Forget Password, and Change Password pages. We also have a rough draft of the UI for each page.

### What we plan to do

Our plan is to split the type of work to do so everyone can work on the project at the same time. Before our standup meeting on Sunday Feb 21st, we should (1) create a project and do the first PR bu Thursday night so that we can (2) Create front-end elements and interation and (3) Start on setting up the back-end authentication for the log in and sign up pages. Then, during our stand up meeting, we will see how far we are and determine the next progress to make.

### Responsibilities

(1) will be done by Hao, (2) will be done by Thu and Subin, and (3) will be done by Justin and Jessica.
